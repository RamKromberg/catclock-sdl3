 * File Name:    catclock_atlas.h
 * Project:      catclock-sdl3 (Modernized Kit-Cat Clock Desktop Widget)
 *
 * Authorship & Collaboration:
 *   - Developed in collaborative partnership between the User and Google Gemini AI.
 *   - Core engine optimization, refactoring architecture, and porting logic
 *     engineered jointly to achieve production-grade performance.
 *
 * Attribution & Legacy:
 *   - Inspired by the classic X11/Motif 'catclock' original program.
 *   - XBM Graphic Assets derived from the historical open-source X11 layout.
 *
 * Engineering Milestones & Refactoring Pass (2026):
 *   - Ported natively to the SDL3 framework with desktop compositing support.
 *   - Designed a low-CPU runtime architecture utilizing pre-baked texture atlases.
 *   - Implemented 1-bit binary threshold rendering to optimize alpha blending.
 *   - Restored polygon scanline rasterization engines to patch geometry gaps.
 *   - Synchronized monotonic ticks with the wall clock to erase frame jitter.
 *   - Enabled adaptive pacing, focus-aware kernel sleeps, and zero-VSync spinlocks.
 *   - Added borderless transparent windows, OS-level hit-tests, and sharp nearest-pixel art integer scaling.
